So far the only reason suggested for its infrequent appearance is that perhaps poppy seeds were expensive or hard to find, and thus were saved for great feasts....We like to bake the poppy seed cake for Easter because it reminds us of the whole lesson of Lent, the seed thrust into the ground to die, that it might live. We have this recipe from a Ukrainian lady....The circle of the cake, baked in the tube pan, is like the circle of eternity--and that is the point of death to self: to live forever.\"\n\nYou may sift powdered sugar over it, or ice it with a thin confectioner's sugar icing, or serve it plain.
